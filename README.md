## Cybersecurity

For the Cyberscurity part, well... my dad👨 wanted me to do __OSCP__ 🖥️ by Offensive Security(OS)

Well, to since my dad had passed his OSCP exam, he made me 
try pentesting on HackTheBox(HTB) servers.

Ever since I've been learning how to do Service Enumeration for servers
and kind of learnt the Linux language.

Furthermore, I also discovered more about exploits 


After he thought I was ready....
 He contacted OS so see if I could take the exam (He should have done this earlier!)
 
 And guess what? They said nope, only above 16. GG 🤷‍♂️
