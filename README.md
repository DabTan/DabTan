### Hi there 👋 I'm DabTan

I'm a young programmer interested in coding, penetration testing and more!

For the penetraion testong part, well... my dad👨 wanted me to do __OSCP__ 🖥️ by Offensive Security(OS)

Well, to since my dad had passed his OSCP exam, he made me 
try pentesting on HackTheBox(HTB) servers.

##### After he thought I was ready....
###### He contacted OS so see if I could take the exam (He should have done this earlier!)


### And guess what? They said nope only above 16. GG 🤷‍♂️
